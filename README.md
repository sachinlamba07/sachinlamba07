### Hi there 👋

Hey there! I'm Sachin Lamba.  I'm from Gurugram, Haryana. I graduated from Delhi University and recently completed a 35-week full-stack web development course at Masai. Although I don't have any work experience yet, my time at Masai equipped me with industry-level knowledge. During my learning journey, I worked on some exciting projects like a cab management system, and CRM, and even developed online streaming websites similar to ZEE5 and Hotstar. Apart from these, I've also done a few mini projects. In my family, we are four members. My mother takes care of our home, my father works as an accountant in a private job, and I have a sister who is currently pursuing her undergraduate studies. Cricket is not just a game for me; I love playing it and analyzing every aspect of it. Looking forward to showcasing my skills and contributing to your team!
